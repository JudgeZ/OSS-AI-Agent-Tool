# Agent Guide

**Mission:** Implement safe, testable code changes via minimal PRs with clear diffs.

**Process:**
1. Read the plan and confirm scope.
2. Retrieve minimal context via indexer (symbolic + semantic + temporal).
3. Propose changes and tests; request approval before write operations.
4. Run tests in sandbox; collect artifacts.
5. Open PR with description, risks, and rollbacks.
