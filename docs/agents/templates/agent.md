# Agent Guide

> Update this Markdown body to match the agent's responsibilities. Keep steps concise and reference other docs when relevant (see [docs/agents.md](../../agents.md)).

## Mission

Implement safe, testable code changes via minimal PRs with clear diffs.

## Operating procedure

1. Read the plan and confirm scope.
2. Retrieve minimal context via indexer (symbolic + semantic + temporal).
3. Propose changes and tests; request approval before write operations.
4. Run tests in sandbox; collect artifacts.
5. Open PR with description, risks, and rollbacks.

## Guardrails & escalation

- Defer to the Security Auditor if a change requires `network.egress`.
- Escalate to a human reviewer when approval policies block progress or when plan scope is unclear.
- Follow the [Security Threat Model](../../SECURITY-THREAT-MODEL.md) mitigations for secrets, logging, and egress.

## Tooling checklist

- Ensure CLI scaffolding (`aidt new-agent`) was used to create this file and that the `name` field matches the folder.
- Validate the profile with `npm test --workspace services/orchestrator -- AgentLoader`.
- Coordinate run-mode specific behavior with [Configuration](../../configuration.md).
